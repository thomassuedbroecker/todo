## Running the app on Bluemix

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up][bluemix_signup_url] for Bluemix, or use an existing account.

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry_url] tool

1. Clone the app to your local environment from your terminal using the following command

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/thomassuedbroecker/todo.git
  ```

1. cd into this newly created directory

1. Connect to IBM Cloud in the command line tool and follow the prompts to log in.
   _Note:_ Optional with -sso

   ```
   $  bx login -a https://api.eu-de.bluemix.net
   ```

1. Create the Cloudant service in IBM Cloud and bind to Cloud Foundry App

  ```
  $ bx cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Shared todo-cloudant
  ```

1. Push the application to IBM Cloud.

  ```
  $ bx cf push
  ```

1. Watch the logs of the application in IBM Cloud.
  ```
  $ bx cf logs todo
  ```

1. Get the number of app instances in IBM Cloud.
  ```
  $ bx cf apps
  ```

And voila! You now have your very own instance of the Todo application running on Bluemix.
Navigate to the application url, e.g. `<application-host>.mybluemix.net` to create Todo.

_Note:_ You can change the color of the kill button, with the _<btn btn-danger btn-lg>_ statement inside the *public/index.html* in line 67.

## Running the app locallly

You can run the application locally, connecting to the Cloudant service running in IBM Bluemix.
To do so you need we will create one file to store the Cloudant credentials.
These credentials can be retrieved in the IBM Bluemix dashboard.

To run the application locally, you will need:
  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)


1. Copy **template.vcap-local.json** to **vcap-local.json**

1. Edit **vcap-local.json** and fill in the *url* of the Cloudant database

1. In the project directory, run:

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

  This will get all the server-side and client-side (through *bower*) dependencies for the project.

1. Start the application

  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

  The console output will look like:
  ```
  Loaded local VCAP { services: { cloudantNoSQLDB: [ [Object] ] } }
  Initializing database...
  Creating database...
  server starting on http://localhost:6020
  Setting current database to todos
  ```
